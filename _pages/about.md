**About Me**

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Utah. I am very interested in the intersection of scientific computing and scientific visualization. I aim to join the scientific computing and visualization community to contribute new and robust ways of visualizing scientific data.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I have taken various classes in data analysis, computer science, and mathematical topics. I also completed a thesis under the supervision of Professor Gordon Kindlmann. We developed a prototype of a web-based framework for scientific visualization applications.
