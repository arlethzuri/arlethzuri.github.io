I am a Computer Science Ph.D. at the University of Utah. I am very interested in the intersection of scientific computing and scientific visualization. I aim to join the scientific computing and visualization community to contribute new and robust ways of visualizing scientific data.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I have taken various classes in data analysis, computer science, and mathematical topics. I also completed a thesis under the supervision of Professor Gordon Kindlmann. We developed a prototype of a web-based framework for scientific visualization applications.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
